description: Required documentation updates for every feature and behavior change.
---

## Policy

Documentation updates are mandatory for all externally meaningful changes.

This includes:

- New features
- API contract changes
- Metadata model changes
- Configuration changes
- Migration and deployment changes
- Operational or observability changes

## Required Update Locations

1. Product and architecture docs: `apps/docs/content/docs`
2. Repository-level summaries when needed: `README.md`
3. Agent operating rules when process changes: `AGENTS.md`

## Structure Requirements

- Place docs in the correct section: `quickstart`, `architecture`, `platform`, `operations`, `development`.
- Add new pages to the nearest `meta.json` to keep navigation structured.
- Prefer extending existing pages before creating fragmented one-off pages.

## Pull Request Checklist

Before merging, confirm:

1. Every behavior change has matching documentation.
2. New pages are discoverable from docs navigation.
3. Commands, endpoints, and configuration names are accurate.
4. Examples and snippets reflect current implementation.

## Exception

Docs updates may be skipped only for purely internal refactors with no behavior or operational impact.
