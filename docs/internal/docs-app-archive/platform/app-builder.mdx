title: App Builder
description: How Qryvanta maps published metadata to worker-ready app navigation and pages.
---

Phase status: in progress.

App Builder links metadata, app navigation, and runtime permissions.
Makers configure apps in admin and maker routes.
Workers use those apps through `/worker/*` routes.

## What Works Today

- Multi-app per tenant through `app_definitions`.
- App navigation through sitemap trees (`areas`, `groups`, `sub_areas`).
- App-level entity permission matrix (`read`, `create`, `update`, `delete`).
- App-scoped form and view defaults.
- Worker runtime pages that resolve schema, form, and view in app scope.
- Runtime query execution with view-level filter and sort metadata.

## Runtime Resolution

Worker pages resolve presentation in this order:

1. Route query override (`?form=...&view=...`).
2. Sitemap page defaults (`default_form`, `default_view`).
3. Metadata defaults from published forms and views.

## Current Endpoints

- `GET /api/apps`
- `POST /api/apps`
- `GET /api/apps/:app_logical_name/entities`
- `POST /api/apps/:app_logical_name/entities`
- `GET /api/apps/:app_logical_name/sitemap`
- `PUT /api/apps/:app_logical_name/sitemap`
- `GET /api/apps/:app_logical_name/permissions`
- `PUT /api/apps/:app_logical_name/permissions`
- `GET /api/workspace/apps`
- `GET /api/workspace/apps/:app_logical_name/navigation`
- `GET /api/workspace/apps/:app_logical_name/entities/:entity_logical_name/schema`
- `GET /api/workspace/apps/:app_logical_name/entities/:entity_logical_name/forms`
- `GET /api/workspace/apps/:app_logical_name/entities/:entity_logical_name/views`
- `GET|POST /api/workspace/apps/:app_logical_name/entities/:entity_logical_name/records`
- `POST /api/workspace/apps/:app_logical_name/entities/:entity_logical_name/records/query`

## In Progress

- Broader maker editing for layout and app composition.
- Better dashboard targets in sitemap pages.
- More publish diagnostics when form, view, and sitemap references drift.
