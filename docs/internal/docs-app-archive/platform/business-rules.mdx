title: Business Rules
description: Metadata-defined condition and action rules executed in worker UI and API runtime paths.
---

Phase status: in progress.

Business rules are defined per entity and can be scoped to entity or form contexts.

## Rule Model

- `scope`: `entity` or `form`
- `conditions[]`: field, operator, value tuples
- `actions[]`: typed runtime actions
- `is_active`: rule on or off

## Current Endpoints

- `GET /api/entities/:entity_logical_name/business-rules`
- `POST /api/entities/:entity_logical_name/business-rules`
- `GET /api/entities/:entity_logical_name/business-rules/:business_rule_logical_name`
- `PUT /api/entities/:entity_logical_name/business-rules/:business_rule_logical_name`
- `DELETE /api/entities/:entity_logical_name/business-rules/:business_rule_logical_name`
- `GET /api/runtime/:entity_logical_name/business-rules`

## Runtime Behavior

- Worker clients use active rules for create and edit flows.
- API runtime enforces active entity-scoped `show_error` rules.
- API runtime applies value and requiredness actions during create and update normalization.

Supported API-side actions include `set_default_value`, `set_field_value`, `set_required`, `set_optional`, and lock behavior on update.

## Maker Routes

- `/maker/entities/:entity_logical_name/business-rules`
- `/maker/entities/:entity_logical_name/business-rules/new`
- `/maker/entities/:entity_logical_name/business-rules/:business_rule_logical_name`

## Done Criteria

- Makers can author and maintain rules in visual workflows.
- Worker and API runtime paths evaluate active rules consistently.
- Rule references are validated against published schema fields.
