title: Relationship Support
description: Lookup field modeling, related-record sub-grids, and publish-time relationship validation.

Phase status: in progress.

Qryvanta supports metadata-defined entity relationships through lookup fields.

## What Works Today

- Relation target selection when creating `relation` fields.
- Relationship templates in maker workflows:
  - single lookup (`1:N`)
  - junction pair for bridge entities (`N:N` modeling pattern)
- Relation fields rendered as lookup selectors in worker forms.
- Related-record sub-grids in form sections.

## Runtime Behavior

- Lookup options resolve from target entity records in tenant and app scope.
- Sub-grids query child records where relation field equals current record id.
- Permission checks apply to parent and child entities.

## Publish Checks

- Relationship targets must exist and be publishable.
- Selective publish can treat included relation targets as in-flight dependencies.
- Dependency edges are returned in issues with `dependency_path`.

## Done Criteria

- Makers can configure lookup relationships in UI.
- Worker pages render lookup and sub-grid behavior from metadata.
- Publish checks report relationship failures with explicit dependency paths.
