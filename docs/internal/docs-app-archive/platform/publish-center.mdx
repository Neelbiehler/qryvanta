title: Publish Center
description: Workspace-level validation, selective publish, and publish history.
---

Phase status: in progress.

Publish Center validates entities and apps before publish.
It also stores run history for later review.

## Endpoints

- `GET /api/publish/checks`
- `POST /api/publish/checks`
- `POST /api/publish/diff`
- `GET /api/publish/history?limit=12`

## Validation Modes

- `dry_run: true` validates selected entities and apps.
- `dry_run: false` validates and publishes selection when no blocking issues exist.

## Issue Model

Responses include:

- `is_publishable`
- `checked_entities`
- `checked_apps`
- `issues[]` with scope, category, severity, message, optional `fix_path`, and optional `dependency_path`

`dependency_path` helps trace blocked relationships and app dependencies.

## Current Checks

- Entity schema integrity
- Form and view reference integrity
- Sitemap target integrity
- App binding consistency
- Dependency-aware relation validation for selective publish

## History

Publish runs are stored in server-side audit storage.
Each entry includes requested and published scopes plus issue counts.

## Typical Categories

- `schema`
- `relationship`
- `form`
- `view`
- `sitemap`
- `binding`
- `unknown`
