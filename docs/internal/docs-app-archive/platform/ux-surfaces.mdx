title: UX Surfaces
description: Route-scoped surfaces for admin, maker, and worker personas.
---

Phase status: in progress.

Qryvanta splits UI routes by persona.
This keeps control-plane pages separate from daily runtime pages.

## Surfaces

| Surface | URL prefix | Typical users |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Admin Center | `/admin` | tenant admins and security operators |
| Maker Center | `/maker` | builders and solution engineers |
| Worker Apps | `/worker` | operators and end users |

Each surface has its own layout, navigation, and access checks.

## Access Resolution

- Surface access is resolved server-side in `GET /auth/me` as `accessible_surfaces`.
- Layouts deny surface routes when the user lacks access.
- API authorization remains enforced at endpoint level.

## Baseline Permission Mapping

- Admin Center: `security.role.manage`, `security.audit.read`, `security.invite.send`
- Maker Center: `metadata.entity.read`, `metadata.entity.create`, `metadata.field.read`, `metadata.field.write`
- Worker Apps: `runtime.record.read`, `runtime.record.read.own`, `runtime.record.write`, `runtime.record.write.own`

## Operational Notes

- Keep new pages inside the correct surface route group.
- Update `apps/web/src/lib/surfaces.ts` when adding navigation items.
- Update `Surface::required_permissions()` in `crates/domain/src/security.rs` when permission mapping changes.
