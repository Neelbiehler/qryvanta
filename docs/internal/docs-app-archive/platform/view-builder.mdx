description: Visual list view authoring for columns, sorting, and filter logic.

Phase status: in progress.

View Builder controls how worker list pages query and render records.

## What Works Today

- Column selection and ordering.
- Width hints and label overrides.
- Default sort field and direction.
- Filter rule groups with `and` or `or` logic.
- Multiple views per entity, including one default view.

## Runtime Contract

- `GET /api/workspace/apps/:app_logical_name/entities/:entity_logical_name/views`
- `GET /api/workspace/apps/:app_logical_name/entities/:entity_logical_name/views/:view_logical_name`
- `POST /api/workspace/apps/:app_logical_name/entities/:entity_logical_name/records/query`

Worker query payload uses saved view filters and sort rules.

## Validation Rules

- Column positions must be non-negative and contiguous.
- Duplicate columns are rejected.
- Invalid sort field references are rejected.

## Done Criteria

- Makers can create and update list views visually.
- Worker list pages render columns and sort from published view metadata.
- Runtime query behavior matches saved filter rules.
