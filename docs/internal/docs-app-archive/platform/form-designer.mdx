Phase status: in progress.

Form Designer lets makers edit form metadata without hand-editing JSON.

## What Works Today

- Field palette for published fields.
- Tab and section layout with one, two, or three columns.
- Per-section related-record sub-grids.
- Multiple forms per entity (`main`, `quick_create`, `quick_view`).
- Save and preview loop against form endpoints.

## Validation Rules

- Non-negative and contiguous positions for tabs, sections, and fields.
- No duplicate layout positions in the same scope.
- Canonical ordering on save to keep payload shape stable.

## Runtime Contract

- `GET /api/workspace/apps/:app_logical_name/entities/:entity_logical_name/forms`
- `GET /api/workspace/apps/:app_logical_name/entities/:entity_logical_name/forms/:form_logical_name`

Worker record pages render published form metadata from these routes.

## Done Criteria

- Makers can create and update forms visually.
- Worker routes render published form layout as configured.
- Validation errors are scoped to invalid tabs, sections, or fields.
