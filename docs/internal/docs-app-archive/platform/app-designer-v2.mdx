title: App Designer v2
description: Unified maker workspace for sitemap editing and page-level form or view defaults.
---

Phase status: in progress.

App Designer v2 is the current maker workspace for app composition.
Legacy maker editing routes now redirect into studio routes.

## Current Scope

- Sitemap editing for areas, groups, and page targets.
- Per-page defaults for form and view selection.
- Inline entity, field, form, and view creation from the solution explorer.
- Embedded security and publish panels inside studio.
- Worker preview actions for flow checks.

## Runtime Contract

- Navigation source: `GET /api/workspace/apps/:app_logical_name/navigation`
- Per-entity forms: `GET /api/workspace/apps/:app_logical_name/entities/:entity_logical_name/forms`
- Per-entity views: `GET /api/workspace/apps/:app_logical_name/entities/:entity_logical_name/views`
- App publish checks: `GET /api/apps/:app_logical_name/publish-checks`

Sitemap saves validate entity targets and optional `default_form` or `default_view` references.

## Known Behavior

- Ordering stays deterministic after save and reload.
- Undo and redo are supported in studio editing flows.
- Worker shell uses sitemap-first navigation and suppresses generic global nav chrome.

## Definition of Done for v2

- Makers can define sitemap hierarchy without raw JSON edits.
- Per-page defaults persist and apply in worker routes.
- Publish checks block invalid form or view references.
