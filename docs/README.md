# Qryvanta Repository Docs

This `docs/` directory is the repository-level source for maintainer, contributor, and coding-agent documentation.

Use `apps/docs/content/docs` for end-user and self-hosting product documentation.

## Start Here

1. `docs/ROADMAP.md` for delivery sequencing and current focus.
2. `docs/adr/` for architecture decisions.
3. `docs/agent/README.md` for coding-agent and contributor workflows.
4. `docs/internal/README.md` for archived and maintainer-only material.

## Documentation Boundary

- Product usage, runtime behavior, and self-hosting runbooks belong in `apps/docs/content/docs`.
- Engineering standards, refactor maps, contribution process, and agent context belong in `docs/`.
