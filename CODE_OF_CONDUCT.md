# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and maintainers pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness.
- Respecting differing opinions and experiences.
- Giving and receiving constructive feedback gracefully.
- Taking responsibility, apologizing, and learning from mistakes.
- Focusing on what is best for the community and project.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission.
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of
acceptable behavior and will take fair corrective action in response to behavior
they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned with this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and when an individual is
officially representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement

To report abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior, contact the
maintainers at `security@qryvanta.org`.

All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. Maintainers
are obligated to respect the privacy and security of reporters.
