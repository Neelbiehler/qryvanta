description: Trigger and action model for background business workflows.

## Workflow Model

- Trigger: event-based (record created/updated/deleted) or schedule-based
- Conditions: boolean filters before actions execute
- Actions: create/update record, call HTTP endpoint, notify channel

## Execution Semantics

1. Trigger event enters queue.
2. Workflow worker resolves metadata and permission context.
3. Actions run with retries and timeout policy.
4. Result is persisted to execution history.

## Reliability Requirements

- Idempotent action handling where possible
- Retry with bounded attempts
- Dead-letter storage for repeated failures
- Full traceability by tenant and actor
