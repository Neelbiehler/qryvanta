## Workflow Model

- Trigger: `manual` or internal `runtime_record_created` per entity
- Canvas steps:
  - `log_message`
  - `create_runtime_record`
  - `condition` with `equals` / `not_equals` / `exists`
- Retry policy: per-workflow `max_attempts` (1-10)

## Execution Semantics

1. A workflow definition is saved in tenant scope (`/api/workflows`).
2. A run starts either by manual execute or runtime-record-created dispatch.
3. Actions execute with bounded retry attempts.
4. Condition steps evaluate payload paths and execute one branch.
5. Failed terminal runs are marked `dead_lettered` with captured reason.
6. Run + attempt history is persisted for tenant observability.

## API Endpoints (v1)

- `GET /api/workflows`
- `POST /api/workflows`
- `POST /api/workflows/:workflow_logical_name/execute`
- `GET /api/workflows/runs?workflow_logical_name=&limit=50&offset=0`
- `GET /api/workflows/runs/:run_id/attempts`

## Maker Automation Canvas

- Maker Center automation now uses a click-first visual canvas with trigger, action, and condition branch nodes.
- Conditions let makers build Yes/No branch paths from trigger payload fields.
- Canvas nodes support drag-to-position layout with connector wires that update in real-time.
- Makers can drag from a step wire port to reconnect flow order, then drop on target handles (`before`, `after`, `to yes`, `to no`, `insert first`).
- The canvas includes snap-to-grid alignment, stage lane guides, and one-click auto-arrange for larger flow readability.
- Canvas editing supports box selection, multi-node drag, and undo/redo (`Cmd/Ctrl+Z`, `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Z`).
- Builder, inspector, and run history are now in-canvas overlays in a full-workspace automation designer.
- Condition connectors support custom branch labels instead of fixed Yes/No text.
- The in-canvas builder includes a searchable, category-based function catalog (trigger/logic/integration/data/operations) with one-click insert modes.
- A n8n-style node picker is available from keyboard (`A`) with fuzzy search and Enter-to-insert at current canvas cursor.
- Function templates now include trigger/integration patterns such as `Webhook Event Trigger`, `HTTP Request`, `Transform Payload`, and `Delay`.
- Existing workflows can be loaded back into the canvas, edited, and saved without leaving the designer.

## Reliability Requirements

- Idempotent action handling where possible
- Retry with bounded attempts
- Dead-letter storage for repeated failures
- Full traceability by tenant and actor
