title: App Builder
description: Render forms and views directly from metadata definitions.
---

Phase status: in progress.

The current app-builder baseline supports metadata-driven workspace behavior without custom frontend deployments.

## Implemented Baseline

- Multi-app model per tenant via `app_definitions`.
- App navigation supports hierarchical sitemap definitions (`areas -> groups -> sub_areas`) with entity targets.
- Backward compatibility: when sitemap is not configured, workspace navigation is derived from existing flat entity bindings.
- Maker form-builder routes are available for standalone entity forms:
  - `/maker/entities/:entity_logical_name/forms`
  - `/maker/entities/:entity_logical_name/forms/new`
  - `/maker/entities/:entity_logical_name/forms/:form_logical_name`
- Form designer includes:
  - field palette with search and placement
  - tab/section/column canvas
  - context-sensitive properties panel
  - preview toggle and save flow against form metadata endpoints
- Maker view-builder routes are available for standalone entity views:
  - `/maker/entities/:entity_logical_name/views`
  - `/maker/entities/:entity_logical_name/views/new`
  - `/maker/entities/:entity_logical_name/views/:view_logical_name`
- View designer includes:
  - active column configurator with ordering + width + label override
  - default sort field/direction controls
  - visual filter rule rows with AND/OR logical mode
  - live preview table using recent runtime records
- Maker sitemap editor route is available for full app navigation design:
  - `/maker/apps/:app_logical_name/sitemap`
- Sitemap editor includes:
  - hierarchical tree editor for areas, groups, and sub areas
  - drag-to-reorder within hierarchy levels
  - context-sensitive target properties (entity, dashboard, custom page)
  - entity target defaults for standalone form and view logical names
- App access granted by assigned roles.
- App-scoped presentation metadata on entity bindings:
  - `forms[]` for named app-scoped form definitions
  - `list_views[]` for named app-scoped list/grid view definitions
  - `default_form_logical_name` and `default_list_view_logical_name` for runtime defaults
  - if defaults are omitted, binding save now falls back to the first configured form/view in each list
  - `default_view_mode` (`grid` | `json`) for initial workspace rendering
- App Studio navigation binding now includes click/drag field layout editing for:
  - Multi-form composition and ordering
  - Multi-view (grid) composition and ordering
  - Default form/view selection per app entity
  - Form/view catalog operations (rename, set default, delete non-default)
- App-scoped role permissions per entity action (`read`, `create`, `update`, `delete`).
- Worker runtime pages resolve forms from published metadata schemas.
- Worker runtime resolves per-app entity presentation overrides before rendering forms and list views.
- Worker runtime list loading applies active view filter/sort metadata through workspace runtime query routes.
- Worker runtime relation fields now render as lookup selects (target entity records) in create and record-detail forms.
- Form designer sections support sub-grid metadata for related-record tables, rendered on worker record detail pages.
- Derived sitemap ordering remains deterministic for equal navigation positions (`navigation_order`, then entity logical name), reducing reorder drift between drag/drop and keyboard reorder saves.
- Entity workbench runtime query supports typed condition arrays (logical mode, operators, sort) with local saved presets (browser-local storage), including JSON import/export for sharing.
- Maker and admin workbenches use sectioned command views (schema/runtime, app/navigation/permissions, roles/registration/temporary access) to reduce control-plane overload.
- Worker entity workspaces provide compact list controls (create, refresh, grid/json view mode, density, quick search) to support high-throughput record handling.
- Worker app viewer now uses a Dynamics-style shell baseline: blue-tinted command bar, persistent resizable sitemap rail, quick-find sitemap filtering, and pinned navigation links for operator workflows.
- Worker command bars now expose page-context actions (for example `New`, `Refresh`, and route-specific back navigation), while the app rail supports desktop collapse/expand and mobile drawer navigation.
- Worker pinned navigation now keeps manual drag order in local storage so frequent entity/dashboard links stay in user-defined sequence across sessions.
- Worker app home pages no longer duplicate full sitemap cards in the content pane; navigation is sidebar-first, and the content area focuses on concise app overview shortcuts.
- Worker entity list experiences now use a denser command-and-grid composition (command bar + quick find + view/form selectors + styled data grid) aligned with Dynamics-style operator workflows.

## Workspace Form and View Retrieval

Worker apps can now retrieve standalone form and view definitions within app scope:

- `GET /api/workspace/apps/:app_logical_name/entities/:entity_logical_name/forms` lists available form definitions.
- `GET /api/workspace/apps/:app_logical_name/entities/:entity_logical_name/forms/:form_logical_name` returns a complete form layout (tabs, sections, field placements).
- `GET /api/workspace/apps/:app_logical_name/entities/:entity_logical_name/views` lists available view definitions.
- `GET /api/workspace/apps/:app_logical_name/entities/:entity_logical_name/views/:view_logical_name` returns a complete view configuration (columns, sort, filters).
- `GET /api/workspace/apps/:app_logical_name/dashboards/:dashboard_logical_name` returns baseline dashboard metadata (widgets + chart definitions) for dashboard sitemap targets.

These endpoints enforce app-scoped read permission on the entity before returning data. Default forms and views are automatically generated on entity publish (see Metadata Runtime for details).

Sitemap entity targets can also specify `default_form` and `default_view`. Worker pages apply these per-page defaults when no explicit route query override is provided.
Sitemap save validation rejects targets that reference unbound entities or missing form/view logical names.
Sitemap save and publish checks also validate structure integrity (duplicate logical names, duplicate positions, and negative positions across areas/groups/sub areas).
Sitemap metadata is normalized on save/retrieval so areas, groups, and sub areas are returned in canonical position order.
Application coverage includes multi-save reorder/undo/redo style sitemap transitions to guard deterministic persisted navigation shape.
Form and view saves also validate layout position integrity (non-negative, non-duplicate, contiguous ordering) for tabs/sections/field placements/sub-grids and view columns.
Worker app home pages now include dashboard sitemap targets, and worker dashboard routes render a minimal metadata-driven dashboard surface for Wave D baseline validation.

## Runtime Behavior

Generated worker pages follow the same flow for each entity workspace:

1. Read app and entity metadata through API contract types.
2. Resolve effective permissions for the authenticated subject.
3. Fetch form/view definitions from workspace endpoints for rendering layout.
4. Render forms and list views from published schema + form/view metadata + app overrides.
5. Apply server-side validation and return field-scoped errors.
