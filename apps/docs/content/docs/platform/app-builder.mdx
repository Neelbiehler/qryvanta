title: App Builder
description: Render forms and views directly from metadata definitions.
---

## Objective

Allow product admins to configure working applications without code changes.

## Implemented Baseline

- Multi-app model per tenant via `app_definitions`.
- App navigation bound to metadata entities.
- App access granted by assigned roles.
- App-scoped presentation metadata on entity bindings:
  - `form_field_logical_names` for worker create-form field ordering
  - `list_field_logical_names` for worker grid column ordering
  - `default_view_mode` (`grid` | `json`) for initial workspace rendering
- App-scoped role permissions per entity action:
  - `read`
  - `create`
  - `update`
  - `delete`
- Worker runtime pages resolve forms from published metadata schemas.
- Worker runtime resolves per-app entity presentation overrides before rendering forms and list views.
- Entity workbench runtime query supports typed condition arrays (logical mode, operators, sort) with local saved presets (browser-local storage), including JSON import/export for sharing.
- Maker and admin workbenches use sectioned command views (schema/runtime, app/navigation/permissions, roles/registration/temporary access) to reduce control-plane overload.
- Worker entity workspaces provide command-bar style controls (create toggle, refresh, grid/json view mode, quick search) to support high-throughput record handling.

## Planned Builder Scope

- Entity and field management UI
- Form layout editor
- List view configuration (columns, sorting, filtering)
- Saved view presets

## Runtime UX

Generated pages should:

1. Read metadata from API contracts.
2. Render field controls by type.
3. Apply server-side validation and permissions.
4. Surface errors with field-level context.

Current worker entry points:

- `GET /api/workspace/apps`
- `GET /api/workspace/apps/:app/navigation`
- `GET /api/workspace/apps/:app/entities/:entity/schema`
- `GET|POST /api/workspace/apps/:app/entities/:entity/records`
- `POST /api/workspace/apps/:app/entities/:entity/records/query`
- `GET|PUT|DELETE /api/workspace/apps/:app/entities/:entity/records/:record_id`

## Non-Goals (Current)

- Pixel-perfect custom page designer.
- Full BI/reporting engine in the first release.
