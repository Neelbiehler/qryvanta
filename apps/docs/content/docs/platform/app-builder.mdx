title: App Builder
description: Render forms and views directly from metadata definitions.
---

Phase status: in progress.

The current app-builder baseline supports metadata-driven workspace behavior without custom frontend deployments.

## Implemented Baseline

- Multi-app model per tenant via `app_definitions`.
- App navigation bound to metadata entities.
- App access granted by assigned roles.
- App-scoped presentation metadata on entity bindings:
  - `form_field_logical_names` for create-form field order
  - `list_field_logical_names` for grid column order
  - `default_view_mode` (`grid` | `json`) for initial workspace rendering
- App-scoped role permissions per entity action (`read`, `create`, `update`, `delete`).
- Worker runtime pages resolve forms from published metadata schemas.
- Worker runtime resolves per-app entity presentation overrides before rendering forms and list views.
- Entity workbench runtime query supports typed condition arrays (logical mode, operators, sort) with local saved presets (browser-local storage), including JSON import/export for sharing.
- Maker and admin workbenches use sectioned command views (schema/runtime, app/navigation/permissions, roles/registration/temporary access) to reduce control-plane overload.
- Worker entity workspaces provide command-bar style controls (create toggle, refresh, grid/json view mode, quick search) to support high-throughput record handling.

## Runtime Behavior

Generated worker pages follow the same flow for each entity workspace:

1. Read app and entity metadata through API contract types.
2. Resolve effective permissions for the authenticated subject.
3. Render forms and list views from published schema + app overrides.
4. Apply server-side validation and return field-scoped errors.

## Current Endpoints

App-builder and workspace routes are documented in `API Conventions`:

- `GET /api/apps`
- `POST /api/apps`
- `GET /api/apps/:app_logical_name/entities`
- `POST /api/apps/:app_logical_name/entities`
- `GET /api/apps/:app_logical_name/permissions`
- `PUT /api/apps/:app_logical_name/permissions`
- `GET /api/workspace/apps`
- `GET /api/workspace/apps/:app_logical_name/navigation`
- `GET /api/workspace/apps/:app_logical_name/entities/:entity_logical_name/schema`
- `GET|POST /api/workspace/apps/:app_logical_name/entities/:entity_logical_name/records`
- `POST /api/workspace/apps/:app_logical_name/entities/:entity_logical_name/records/query`
- `GET|PUT|DELETE /api/workspace/apps/:app_logical_name/entities/:entity_logical_name/records/:record_id`

## Planned Scope

- Entity and field management UI
- Form layout editor
- List view configuration (columns, sorting, filtering)
- Saved view presets

## Non-Goals (Current)

- Pixel-perfect custom page designer.
- Full BI/reporting engine in the first release.
