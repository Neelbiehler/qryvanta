title: App Builder
description: Render forms and views directly from metadata definitions.
---

Phase status: in progress.

The current app-builder baseline supports metadata-driven workspace behavior without custom frontend deployments.

## Implemented Baseline

- Multi-app model per tenant via `app_definitions`.
- App navigation supports hierarchical sitemap definitions (`areas -> groups -> sub_areas`) with entity targets.
- Backward compatibility: when sitemap is not configured, workspace navigation is derived from existing flat entity bindings.
- Maker form-builder routes are available for standalone entity forms:
  - `/maker/entities/:entity_logical_name/forms`
  - `/maker/entities/:entity_logical_name/forms/new`
  - `/maker/entities/:entity_logical_name/forms/:form_logical_name`
- Form designer includes:
  - field palette with search and placement
  - tab/section/column canvas
  - context-sensitive properties panel
  - preview toggle and save flow against form metadata endpoints
- Maker view-builder routes are available for standalone entity views:
  - `/maker/entities/:entity_logical_name/views`
  - `/maker/entities/:entity_logical_name/views/new`
  - `/maker/entities/:entity_logical_name/views/:view_logical_name`
- View designer includes:
  - active column configurator with ordering + width + label override
  - default sort field/direction controls
  - visual filter rule rows with AND/OR logical mode
  - live preview table using recent runtime records
- Maker sitemap editor route is available for full app navigation design:
  - `/maker/apps/:app_logical_name/sitemap`
- Sitemap editor includes:
  - hierarchical tree editor for areas, groups, and sub areas
  - drag-to-reorder within hierarchy levels
  - context-sensitive target properties (entity, dashboard, custom page)
  - entity target defaults for standalone form and view logical names
- App access granted by assigned roles.
- App-scoped presentation metadata on entity bindings:
  - `forms[]` for named app-scoped form definitions
  - `list_views[]` for named app-scoped list/grid view definitions
  - `default_form_logical_name` and `default_list_view_logical_name` for runtime defaults
  - `default_view_mode` (`grid` | `json`) for initial workspace rendering
- App Studio navigation binding now includes click/drag field layout editing for:
  - Multi-form composition and ordering
  - Multi-view (grid) composition and ordering
  - Default form/view selection per app entity
  - Form/view catalog operations (rename, set default, delete non-default)
- App-scoped role permissions per entity action (`read`, `create`, `update`, `delete`).
- Worker runtime pages resolve forms from published metadata schemas.
- Worker runtime resolves per-app entity presentation overrides before rendering forms and list views.
- Entity workbench runtime query supports typed condition arrays (logical mode, operators, sort) with local saved presets (browser-local storage), including JSON import/export for sharing.
- Maker and admin workbenches use sectioned command views (schema/runtime, app/navigation/permissions, roles/registration/temporary access) to reduce control-plane overload.
- Worker entity workspaces provide command-bar style controls (create toggle, refresh, grid/json view mode, quick search) to support high-throughput record handling.

## Runtime Behavior

Generated worker pages follow the same flow for each entity workspace:

1. Read app and entity metadata through API contract types.
2. Resolve effective permissions for the authenticated subject.
3. Render forms and list views from published schema + app overrides.
4. Apply server-side validation and return field-scoped errors.

## Current Endpoints

App-builder and workspace routes are documented in `API Conventions`:

- `GET /api/apps`
- `POST /api/apps`
- `GET /api/apps/:app_logical_name/entities`
- `POST /api/apps/:app_logical_name/entities`
- `GET /api/apps/:app_logical_name/permissions`
- `PUT /api/apps/:app_logical_name/permissions`
- `GET /api/apps/:app_logical_name/sitemap`
- `PUT /api/apps/:app_logical_name/sitemap`
- `GET /api/workspace/apps`
- `GET /api/workspace/apps/:app_logical_name/navigation`
- `GET /api/workspace/apps/:app_logical_name/entities/:entity_logical_name/schema`
- `GET|POST /api/workspace/apps/:app_logical_name/entities/:entity_logical_name/records`
- `POST /api/workspace/apps/:app_logical_name/entities/:entity_logical_name/records/query`
- `GET|PUT|DELETE /api/workspace/apps/:app_logical_name/entities/:entity_logical_name/records/:record_id`

## Planned Scope

- Entity and field management UI
- Form layout editor (baseline implemented)
- List view configuration (baseline implemented)
- Saved view presets

## Non-Goals (Current)

- Pixel-perfect custom page designer.
- Full BI/reporting engine in the first release.
