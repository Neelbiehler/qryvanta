## Objective

Allow product admins to configure working applications without code changes.

## Planned Builder Scope

- Entity and field management UI
- Form layout editor
- List view configuration (columns, sorting, filtering)
- Saved view presets

## Runtime UX

Generated pages should:

1. Read metadata from API contracts.
2. Render field controls by type.
3. Apply server-side validation and permissions.
4. Surface errors with field-level context.

## Non-Goals (Current)

- Pixel-perfect custom page designer.
- Full BI/reporting engine in the first release.
