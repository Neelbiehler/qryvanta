title: Metadata Runtime
description: Core model for entities, fields, constraints, and publish lifecycle.
---

## Goal

Represent business models as metadata and execute runtime behavior from published definitions.

## Planned Model Concepts

- Entity: stable logical name + display metadata
- Field: type, validation, default, required flag
- Relation: one-to-many and many-to-one references
- Constraint: uniqueness, required groups, domain limits
- Versioning: draft and published states

## Lifecycle

1. Create or edit draft metadata.
2. Validate metadata integrity.
3. Publish immutable version.
4. Runtime APIs use only published versions.

## Design Guardrails

- Never couple runtime behavior to hardcoded entity tables.
- Keep validation deterministic and explicit.
- Return meaningful `AppError::Validation` messages for model violations.
