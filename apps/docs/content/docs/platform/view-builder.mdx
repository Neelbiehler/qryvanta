title: View Builder
description: Phase 2 visual list view builder for columns, sorting, and filters.
---

Phase status: in progress (Phase 2).

## Outcome

Makers can configure list/grid views visually, including default sort and filter logic.

## Scope

- Column selection, ordering, width hints, and label overrides.
- Default sort configuration with field and direction.
- Visual filter groups with logical mode (`and` or `or`).
- Multiple views per entity, including an explicit default view.
- Preview table with representative runtime records.

## Runtime Contract

- Designer writes view metadata through view endpoints.
- Worker runtime resolves available and selected views from workspace endpoints:
  - `GET /api/workspace/apps/:app_logical_name/entities/:entity_logical_name/views`
  - `GET /api/workspace/apps/:app_logical_name/entities/:entity_logical_name/views/:view_logical_name`
- Worker runtime record loading applies selected view metadata through:
  - `POST /api/workspace/apps/:app_logical_name/entities/:entity_logical_name/records/query`
  - `filter_criteria.conditions[]` mapped to runtime query conditions
  - `default_sort` mapped to runtime query sort

## Implemented Baseline

- Designer header surfaces draft state (`Draft changes` vs `Draft saved`) and published-schema readiness.
- View save validation now enforces column position integrity (non-negative, non-duplicate, contiguous ordering) to stabilize keyboard reorder and undo/redo flows.
- View metadata is normalized on save so columns are persisted in canonical position order.
- Repeated save transitions (column reorder -> undo -> redo style payloads) are covered in application tests to confirm deterministic persisted ordering.

## UX Requirements

- Makers can reorder columns and immediately see the preview update.
- Filter builder uses readable field/operator/value controls (no raw query language).
- Validation errors identify invalid sort fields, duplicate columns, or malformed filters.

## Definition of Done

- Maker can create, update, and select default views visually.
- Worker grid pages render columns and default sort from published view metadata.
- Filter metadata is persisted and enforced by runtime query behavior.
- Documentation is updated for view payloads, constraints, and runtime effects.
