description: Metadata runtime, app builder behavior, automation engine, and API contracts.
---

This section documents platform behavior that users and integrators can depend on today, plus planned scope.

## Implemented Now

- Metadata entities, fields, publish lifecycle, and runtime CRUD/query APIs.
- App definitions, navigation bindings, app-scoped entity permissions, and worker-facing runtime routes.
- Surface-aware UX routing for Admin, Maker, and Worker experiences.
- Automation execution with inline or queued mode, retry handling, and run history.

## In Progress

- Broader app-builder editing workflows for form and list design.
- Expanded automation action catalog and trigger integrations.
- Additional hardening and operational controls around runtime scale.
