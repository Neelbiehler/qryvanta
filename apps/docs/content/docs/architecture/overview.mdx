title: Overview
description: Architectural direction for an open and self-hostable business platform.
---

Qryvanta uses a modular monorepo and strict layer boundaries to support long-term evolution from metadata CRUD into a full platform runtime.

Phase 1 foundation uses:

- PostgreSQL for durable metadata, tenancy, and session storage
- First-party WebAuthn passkey identity
- Axum BFF auth flow with server-side session cookies and origin checks

## Principles

1. Domain invariants are independent from transport and storage.
2. Application use-cases orchestrate behavior via ports.
3. Infrastructure implements ports and can be replaced.
4. API and web are delivery surfaces, not business cores.
5. Every major capability is self-hostable by default.

## Target Capability Map

- Metadata runtime: entities, fields, relations, validation.
- App runtime: generated forms and views.
- Automation runtime: triggers, actions, retries, run history.
- Security model: RBAC, tenant boundaries, auditability.
- Operations: containerized deployment and backup/restore.
