## Core Runtime Services

1. `Metadata Service`: schema definitions, lifecycle, publish/version control.
2. `Record Runtime`: dynamic CRUD/query against published metadata.
3. `Automation Engine`: trigger dispatcher + action workers.
4. `Identity and Access`: authn, authz, role mapping, tenant scoping.
5. `Audit and Observability`: immutable logs, metrics, and traces.

## Data and Execution Flow

1. Admin publishes metadata.
2. Runtime exposes entity record behavior from published schema.
3. Record events trigger workflow execution.
4. Every write operation is audited with actor + tenant context.

## Deployment Topology

- API service
- Web app
- Docs app
- Database
- Background worker runtime
- Optional cache/queue for scale
