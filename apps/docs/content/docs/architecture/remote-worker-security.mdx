title: Remote Worker Security Model
description: Threat model and security boundaries for queued workflow workers.
---

## Scope

This model applies when `WORKFLOW_EXECUTION_MODE=queued` and one or more `qryvanta-worker` processes execute workflow runs outside API request handlers.

## Trust Boundaries

1. Browser/user traffic terminates at API session/auth middleware.
2. Worker traffic uses a separate internal channel (`/api/internal/worker/jobs/claim`) with bearer-token authentication.
3. Workflow workers use database credentials to execute workflow actions and persist run outcomes.

## Worker Auth and Transport

- Worker claim requests require `Authorization: Bearer <WORKER_SHARED_SECRET>`.
- Worker identity is explicit via `x-qryvanta-worker-id` and used for job leasing.
- Worker heartbeat and queue-stats endpoints share the same internal auth model.
- Internal worker routes bypass browser same-origin checks and rely on worker auth middleware.
- Operators should restrict internal route reachability to private networks or service mesh paths.

## Threat Scenarios and Controls

### RCE (Remote Code Execution)

- Workflow actions are constrained to platform-defined action types (`log_message`, `create_runtime_record`).
- No user-supplied executable code is evaluated in worker runtime.
- Worker binaries should run with least privilege and isolated OS/container identities.

### XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)

- Worker endpoints are not browser-facing APIs and do not use session cookies.
- Browser mutation defenses remain active for non-worker routes.
- Workflow payloads are treated as data and should still be escaped/sanitized at presentation boundaries in web clients.

### SQLi (SQL Injection)

- Queue claims, run updates, and metadata writes use parameterized SQL via repository adapters.
- Tenant IDs are explicit in workflow repository operations to preserve tenant scope isolation.
- Worker-auth headers are never interpolated into SQL statements.

## Operational Hardening

- Rotate `WORKER_SHARED_SECRET` on a fixed schedule and after incident response events.
- Use distinct DB credentials for worker and API processes when infrastructure supports role scoping.
- Monitor queue lease churn (`leased` jobs with repeated expiry) as a reliability and abuse signal.
- Keep worker nodes patched and restart on known-bad runtime states.
