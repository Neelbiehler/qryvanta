title: Architecture
description: System model, layer boundaries, and runtime topology for Qryvanta.

Use this section before changing behavior in API, domain logic, or persistence.

## Read Order

1. `Overview`
2. `Rust Layers`
3. `Database`
4. `Auth and Sessions`
5. `Runtime Components`
6. `Remote Worker Security Model`

## Current Baseline

- Rust-first monorepo with domain/application/infrastructure layering.
- Axum API as composition root and transport adapter.
- Next.js web client consuming API contracts.
- PostgreSQL persistence for metadata, auth/session state, and runtime records.
- Optional queued worker runtime for asynchronous automation runs.

## Scope Boundary

- Keep business invariants in `crates/domain`.
- Keep use-case orchestration in `crates/application`.
- Keep framework code in `apps/api` and adapters in `crates/infrastructure`.
