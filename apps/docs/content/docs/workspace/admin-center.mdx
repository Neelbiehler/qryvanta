description: Tenant access administration, invite policy, and audit visibility.

Admin Center is for tenant and security administration.

Use Admin Center before broad user rollout and after every permission change.

## Primary Tasks

- Create and manage custom roles.
- Assign roles to tenant members.
- Configure registration mode (`invite_only` or `open`).
- Review audit log entries and exports.
- Manage temporary privileged access grants.

## First Admin Checklist

1. Verify owner role access after bootstrap.
2. Create role templates for makers and workers.
3. Assign members to roles.
4. Confirm audit visibility for metadata and security actions.
5. Set registration mode to `invite_only` unless open registration is required.

## Ongoing Operations

- Keep role names tied to job functions.
- Use temporary privileged access for short-term elevated work.
- Review audit filters by action and subject during incident triage.
- Remove stale access grants and disabled-user assignments.

## Minimum Role Model

Use at least these role groups in most tenants:

1. `tenant_owner` for full administration.
2. maker role for metadata and publish workflows.
3. worker role for runtime records only.
4. read-only role for auditors and support users.

## When Access Looks Wrong

1. Check role assignment for the user subject.
2. Check app-level permissions for that role.
3. Ask the user to re-authenticate to refresh surface access state.
