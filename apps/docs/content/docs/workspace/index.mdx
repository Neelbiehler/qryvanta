description: How Admin Center, Maker Center, and Worker Apps work together in daily product use.
---

Qryvanta separates product usage into role-based surfaces.
Each surface has its own navigation and permission checks.

## Surfaces

- Admin Center (`/admin`): roles, assignments, invite flow, audit controls.
- Maker Center (`/maker`): entities, fields, forms, views, and publish actions.
- Worker Apps (`/worker`): runtime record creation, updates, and daily operations.
- Docs (`/docs`): user and operator reference.

The same tenant can have users in one surface or in multiple surfaces.

## Recommended Team Flow

1. Admin configures access and invites users.
2. Maker defines data model and app navigation.
3. Maker publishes metadata.
4. Worker users run day-to-day processes in generated app pages.
5. Admin reviews audit and access events.

## Practical Rules

- Control-plane tasks stay in admin and maker surfaces.
- Runtime tasks stay in worker surfaces.
- Permissions and publish checks gate what appears to each role.
- When a role lacks access, fix role assignments before changing metadata.

## Page Guide

- Read `Admin Center` when setting roles, invites, and audit policy.
- Read `Maker Center` when changing entities, forms, views, or navigation.
- Read `Worker Apps` when validating daily runtime behavior.
- Read `Publish and Access` before release windows.
