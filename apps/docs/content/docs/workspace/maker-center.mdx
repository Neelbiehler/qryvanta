description: Build metadata-driven apps with entities, forms, views, rules, and publish checks.
---

Maker Center is for building and publishing tenant apps.

Draft edits stay inactive until publish.
Worker Apps only use published metadata.

## Primary Tasks

- Create entities and fields.
- Configure forms and list views.
- Model relationships.
- Set app navigation.
- Run publish checks and publish selected scopes.
- Define business rules for write-time validation and value defaults.

## Typical Build Cycle

1. Define entity and field model.
2. Configure form layout and list view columns.
3. Bind entities into an app sitemap.
4. Run publish checks.
5. Publish.
6. Validate behavior in Worker Apps.
7. Fix issues and publish again if needed.

## Example Change

For a sales flow update:

1. Add `deal.stage` choice field.
2. Add `deal.stage` to the main deal form.
3. Add `deal.stage` to the default deal view.
4. Publish and verify that worker users can filter by stage.

## Common Failure Points

- Missing relation targets.
- Form or view references to removed fields.
- Sitemap references to unbound entities.
- Missing app permission for a role that needs runtime write access.

Use publish checks to catch these before runtime users are affected.

## Maker Quality Checklist

1. Entity names and field names are stable and readable.
2. Forms include required fields and relation inputs.
3. Views include columns needed for daily worker tasks.
4. App navigation groups related entities under clear labels.
5. Publish checks return zero blocking issues.
