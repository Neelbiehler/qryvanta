title: Publish and Access
description: Coordinate metadata publish with role and app access changes.
---

Publish and access management should happen together.
This avoids runtime pages that users can reach but cannot use.

This page is useful for release windows and change approvals.

## Recommended Order

1. Update metadata in Maker Center.
2. Run publish checks.
3. Update app permissions in Admin or Maker workflows.
4. Publish selected scopes.
5. Validate in Worker Apps with a non-owner user.
6. Record the change in your team change log.

## Validation Focus

- Entity and relation dependencies.
- Form and view reference integrity.
- App role permission coverage for required actions.
- Registration mode and invite policy after role changes.

## Pre-Release Check

1. Use a non-owner maker user for final publish checks.
2. Use a non-owner worker user for runtime validation.
3. Confirm audit events are recorded for publish and role changes.
4. Confirm rollback owner and rollback window are documented.

## Rollout Tip

Use role-scoped pilot users before broad tenant rollout.
This catches runtime permission gaps early.

## Rollback Guidance

If a rollout fails:

1. Remove access to impacted app routes for non-admin roles.
2. Revert metadata to last known good shape in Maker Center.
3. Publish the corrected scope.
4. Validate with pilot users before reopening access.
