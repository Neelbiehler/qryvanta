title: Worker Apps
description: Use generated runtime pages for record operations in daily workflows.
---

Worker Apps are the runtime side of Qryvanta.
Pages and record forms come from published metadata.

Worker users do not need access to maker tooling.
They work only with runtime routes and allowed actions.

## Primary Tasks

- Browse records by app navigation.
- Create and update records through published forms.
- Use list views and filters defined by makers.
- Work within role-based runtime permissions.
- Follow app navigation configured by makers.

## Runtime Behavior

- Forms and views resolve by app scope and page defaults.
- Field validation executes on API write paths.
- Access checks execute on every data route.
- Related-record lookups only show records allowed by app scope and role scope.

Record actions require matching role permissions:

- `read` to open records and list pages
- `create` to create new records
- `update` to edit existing records
- `delete` to remove records

## Daily Operator Checks

- Confirm records open with expected form layout.
- Confirm list columns and sort match published view.
- Confirm denied actions match assigned role permissions.
- Confirm relation fields show expected target records.

## Troubleshooting

If a worker cannot create or update records:

1. Verify app role permission (`create` or `update`).
2. Verify form has all required fields exposed.
3. Verify metadata changes were published.
