title: Qryvanta Documentation
description: Open-source docs for local setup, architecture boundaries, platform behavior, and self-hosting operations.
---

Qryvanta is an open-source, self-hostable, metadata-driven business platform.

Qryvanta is in active development and is not ready for production use yet.

Use this documentation to run the project locally, understand current implementation boundaries, and contribute safely.

Primary project domain: `qryvanta.org`. The `qryvanta.com` domain is reserved for a future cloud offering.

## Start Here

1. Follow `Quickstart` to run API, web, landing, and docs locally.
2. Read `Architecture` before changing runtime behavior or persistence.
3. Use `Platform` to understand metadata runtime, app builder scope, automation, and API contracts.
4. Use `Operations` for environment configuration and deployment guidance.
5. Use `Development` for standards, contribution workflow, and roadmap status.

## Documentation Areas

- `Quickstart`: first-run sequence and local development loop.
- `Architecture`: monorepo boundaries, auth/session model, database model, worker trust boundaries.
- `Platform`: metadata runtime model, app builder scope, UX surfaces, automation engine, API route conventions.
- `Operations`: self-hosting baseline, configuration variables, email delivery, observability targets.
- `Development`: engineering standards, docs policy, API contract workflow, roadmap.

## Product Boundary

- `qryvanta.org` docs cover the OSS platform.
- Cloud-control-plane behavior belongs to `qryvanta.com` and is documented separately.
