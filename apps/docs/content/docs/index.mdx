title: Qryvanta Documentation
description: Open-source, self-hostable platform docs for architecture, metadata runtime, automation, and operations.
---

Qryvanta is a metadata-driven business platform built to be a practical, open alternative to closed, proprietary business platform suites.

Use this documentation to move from local setup to platform implementation and production operations.

Primary project domain: `qryvanta.org`. The `qryvanta.com` domain is reserved for a future cloud offering.

## Documentation Areas

- `Quickstart`: install dependencies, run the stack, and validate baseline health.
- `Architecture`: understand layer boundaries and runtime composition.
- `Platform`: design metadata models, app surfaces, automations, and API behavior.
- `Operations`: self-hosting, configuration, and reliability controls.
- `Development`: engineering standards and roadmap sequencing.

## First Steps

1. Open `Quickstart` and run the local environment.
2. Read `Architecture` before adding new modules.
3. Follow `Development` standards for all pull requests.
