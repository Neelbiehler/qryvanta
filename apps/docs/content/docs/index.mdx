description: End-user and self-hosting guides for Qryvanta.

Qryvanta is an open-source, self-hostable business platform.
You model business data in metadata, publish changes, and use generated runtime pages.

Qryvanta is in active development and is not ready for production use yet.

This site is for admins, makers, worker users, and self-hosting operators.
It explains day-to-day product usage and runtime operations.

`qryvanta.org` is the open-source product surface.
`qryvanta.com` is the managed cloud surface.

## Product Snapshot

- Open source first: run on your own infrastructure.
- Rust-first backend: API, security, and worker runtime are implemented in Rust.
- Metadata-driven runtime: entities, forms, views, and navigation are published from metadata.
- Cloud optionality: teams that want managed hosting can use `qryvanta.com`.

## What You Can Do Today

- Define entities and fields in Maker Center.
- Publish metadata and use generated runtime pages in Worker Apps.
- Control access with roles, app permissions, and tenant registration mode.
- Run automation workflows in inline mode or queued worker mode.

## Read Order

1. `Quickstart` for first run.
2. `Workspace` for role-based product flows.
3. `Concepts` for publish lifecycle and runtime behavior.
4. `Operations` for self-hosting checks and incident readiness.

## Terminology

- Surface: a route area such as `/admin`, `/maker`, or `/worker`.
- Workspace: the docs section that explains surface-based product usage.
- Runtime: record APIs and pages used by worker users.
- Self-hosting: running Qryvanta in your own infrastructure.

## Product Boundary

- This docs app covers open-source product usage and self-hosting.
- Internal maintainer and coding-agent docs are in repository `docs/`.
