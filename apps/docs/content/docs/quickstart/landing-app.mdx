description: Run and customize the standalone Qryvanta landing site.

Qryvanta includes a dedicated marketing and project landing app in `apps/landing`.

## Why It Exists

- Serve `qryvanta.org` as the open-source project home.
- Keep cloud-offering messaging separate on `qryvanta.com`.
- Keep the authenticated product app (`apps/web`) focused on workspace workflows.
- Iterate public-facing messaging and visual design independently.
- Reuse `@qryvanta/ui` primitives for consistent visual language across apps.

## Run Locally

```bash
pnpm --filter @qryvanta/landing dev
```

Default URL: `http://localhost:3003`

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 16 App Router
- React 19
- Tailwind CSS 4
- Shared components from `@qryvanta/ui`
- Orb hero animation powered by `react-ai-orb`

## Design Notes

- The page uses the same card/button/badge primitives as workspace surfaces.
- A small React orb animation (`react-ai-orb`) is used as the brand mark in the navbar.
- The hero uses a split layout with primary messaging on the left and a project hub rail on the right (docs, architecture, contribution links), then a full-width animated product walkthrough below that mirrors Admin, Maker, Worker, and Automation surfaces from `apps/web`.
- A dedicated OSS-first section bridges to `qryvanta.com` for teams that prefer a managed cloud path.
- Primary call-to-action links are project-first (`docs` and `GitHub`) rather than app-login focused.
