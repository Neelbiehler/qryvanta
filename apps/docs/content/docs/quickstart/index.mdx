description: First-run setup for a local Qryvanta instance.
---

Qryvanta is in active development and is not ready for production use yet.

Use this page to start a local instance and verify that the product is usable.

## Prerequisites

- Rust stable (`rustup`)
- Node.js 22+
- pnpm 10+
- Docker + Docker Compose

## First Run

1. Install workspace dependencies.

```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Start Postgres and Redis.

```bash
pnpm infra:up
```

3. Create your local `.env` file.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Start API, web, and docs.

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Local URLs:

- API: `http://localhost:3001`
- Web: `http://localhost:3000`
- Docs: `http://127.0.0.1:3002`
- Postgres: `127.0.0.1:5432`

## Verify Runtime Health

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3001/health
```

Expected response:

```json
{"status":"ok","ready":true,"postgres":{"status":"ok","detail":null},"redis":{"status":"ok","detail":null}}
```

If `ready` is `false`, check container health in `Docker Setup`.

## Verify Web Access

1. Open `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Complete bootstrap or registration.
3. Confirm that at least one surface route opens.
4. Continue in `Local Development` for the first publish flow.

## Next Pages

- `Docker Setup` for container checks and local troubleshooting.
- `Local Development` for first login and first app flow.
