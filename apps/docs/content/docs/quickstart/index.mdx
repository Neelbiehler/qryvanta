Qryvanta is in active development and is not ready for production use yet.

Use this page as the canonical local setup path.

## Prerequisites

- Rust stable (`rustup`)
- Node.js 22+
- pnpm 10+
- Docker + Docker Compose

## First Run

1. Install workspace dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Start local infrastructure:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

3. Create local environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Run baseline Rust checks:

```bash
cargo xcheck
```

5. Start development apps:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Default local services:

- API: `http://localhost:3001`
- Web: `http://localhost:3000`
- Landing: `http://localhost:3003`
- Docs: `http://127.0.0.1:3002`

## Verify Baseline

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3001/health
```

Expected:

```json
{"status":"ok"}
```
