## Logging

- Use structured logs with request and tenant context.
- Log errors with actionable messages and identifiers.
- Avoid logging secrets or sensitive payloads.

## Metrics

Track at minimum:

- Request rate, latency, and error rate
- Workflow executions, retries, and dead-letter counts
- Queue depth and worker throughput
- Worker heartbeat freshness and active worker count
- DB query latency and connection pool health

## Tracing

Add distributed trace spans across:

1. HTTP request entry
2. Application use-case execution
3. Infrastructure calls
4. Workflow action pipelines

Use trace ids in logs for correlation.
