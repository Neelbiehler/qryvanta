description: Deployment expectations for running Qryvanta on your own infrastructure.

## Expected Runtime Stack

- API service
- Web app
- Docs app
- Postgres database
- Background worker process (`qryvanta-worker`) when workflow execution is queued
- Optional cache/queue service

## Packaging Direction

1. Docker Compose baseline for local and small deployments
2. Environment-based configuration
3. Upgrade-safe migrations
4. Backup and restore procedures

## Minimum Production Checklist

- TLS termination configured
- Secrets managed outside source control
- Database backups scheduled and tested
- Health endpoints monitored

## Worker Runtime Startup

When `WORKFLOW_EXECUTION_MODE=queued`, run at least one worker process:

```bash
cargo run -p qryvanta-worker
```

Scale horizontally by increasing worker replicas; each worker claims leased jobs with `x-qryvanta-worker-id` identity.
