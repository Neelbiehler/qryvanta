title: Metadata and Publishing
description: How draft metadata becomes active runtime behavior.
---

Makers edit metadata in draft mode.
Runtime behavior changes only after publish.

This contract keeps runtime behavior predictable for worker users.

## Draft to Runtime

1. Define or update entities and fields.
2. Update forms, views, and app navigation.
3. Run publish checks.
4. Publish selected scopes.
5. Validate the result in Worker Apps.

## What Publish Checks Catch

- Relation dependencies
- Missing field references in forms and views
- Invalid sitemap or app bindings
- App permission and binding issues that block runtime access

## Common Rule

If users report missing fields or old layouts, verify the latest published version first.

Draft changes do not affect runtime pages until publish completes.

## Safe Change Pattern

1. Create or edit metadata in a draft.
2. Run checks and fix blocking issues.
3. Publish during a defined change window.
4. Verify with a pilot worker user before broad rollout.
