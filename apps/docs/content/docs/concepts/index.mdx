description: Core product concepts for metadata, runtime records, and workflow automation.
---

Qryvanta behavior starts with metadata.
Runtime pages and APIs execute from published metadata versions.

## Core Concepts

- Metadata model: entities, fields, forms, views, and app navigation.
- Publish lifecycle: draft edits become active after publish.
- Runtime records: create and update operations use published schema.
- Automation: workflow runs react to events or manual execution.
- Tenant security: every runtime path is scoped by tenant and role permissions.

## Why This Matters

When a page or API result looks wrong, start with the published metadata version and app scope.

## Concept Boundaries

- Product behavior docs are in this section.
- Internal implementation details are in repository `docs/internal/`.
