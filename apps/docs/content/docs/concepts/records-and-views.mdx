description: How forms, list views, and runtime permissions shape record workflows.
---

Worker users handle records through forms and list views.
Both are defined in metadata and applied in app scope.

## Record Flow

1. Open app and entity route.
2. List records with the active view.
3. Open or create record with the active form.
4. Submit changes.
5. API validates values and permissions.
6. Updated data appears in list views based on current filter rules.

## What Controls the Experience

- Published form layout
- Published list view columns, sort, and filters
- App-scoped form and view defaults
- Role and runtime permissions
- Business rules that set values or block invalid writes

## Troubleshooting Tip

When users see different actions, compare their assigned roles and app permissions.

If users see old columns or old labels, check the latest published metadata version.
