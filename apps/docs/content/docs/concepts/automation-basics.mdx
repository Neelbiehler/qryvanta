description: Workflow trigger and action behavior for runtime operations.
---

Qryvanta workflows run from metadata definitions.
A workflow starts from a trigger and executes action steps.

## Trigger Types

- Manual execution
- Runtime record created

More trigger types are planned and will be documented when released.

## Execution Modes

- Inline mode executes in API request flow.
- Queued mode executes in `qryvanta-worker` processes.

Queued mode is recommended for isolated worker scaling.

Current trigger coverage is manual run and record-created events.

## Failure Handling

- Each workflow has bounded retry attempts.
- Failed terminal runs are stored for later inspection.
- Run and attempt history stay in tenant scope.
- Queue stats can be queried for operator dashboards.

## Operational Checks

- Monitor run and attempt history.
- Watch queue depth and worker heartbeats in queued mode.
- Review failed runs and dead-lettered items.
- Confirm worker shared secret rotation policy is active in production-like environments.
