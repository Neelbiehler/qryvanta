## Required Reading

- `AGENTS.md`
- `RUST_STYLE_GUIDE.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`

## Rust Expectations

- Respect crate boundaries and dependency direction.
- Keep business behavior in domain/application layers.
- Return typed errors with clear mapping to API status codes.
- Add tests for invariants and use-cases.

## Dependency Update Expectations

- Keep React and React DOM versions aligned exactly; mismatches fail web builds.
- Use `eslint .` for frontend linting to stay compatible across Next.js major upgrades.
- Dependabot updates must be CI-green before merge; defer updates with known upstream incompatibilities until compatible releases exist.
