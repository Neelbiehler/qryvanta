title: UI Library
description: Shared UI component package for consistent app surfaces.
---

Qryvanta ships reusable web primitives from `@qryvanta/ui` in `packages/ui`.
The package is based on shadcn patterns and is the default source for shared application components.

`@qryvanta/ui` is publishable as a standalone npm package so other repositories (including `qryvanta.com`) can consume the same component library without source duplication.

The current package includes standardized form primitives (`Input`, `Textarea`, `Checkbox`, `Select`), card/layout primitives, table primitives, accessible menu/avatar controls, feedback primitives (`Notice`), and workspace experience primitives (`PageHeader`, `StatusBadge`).

## Usage

Import components from the package root:

```tsx
import { Button, Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle } from "@qryvanta/ui";

import {
  DropdownMenu,
  DropdownMenuContent,
  DropdownMenuItem,
  DropdownMenuTrigger,
} from "@qryvanta/ui/dropdown-menu";
```

Do not import from `apps/web/src/components/ui` for shared primitives.

## Adding Components

1. Add the component in `packages/ui/src/components`.
2. Reuse `packages/ui/src/lib/cn.ts` for class merging.
3. Export server-safe components from `packages/ui/src/index.ts`; expose client-only primitives via a dedicated subpath entry (for example `@qryvanta/ui/dropdown-menu`).
4. Update consuming apps to import from `@qryvanta/ui`.

## Form Standards

- Prefer `@qryvanta/ui` form controls over raw HTML controls in app code.
- Use `Label` with an explicit `htmlFor` for every control.
- Keep control styling centralized in the UI package to avoid style drift between pages.
- Use typed API DTOs from `@qryvanta/api-types` when wiring form submissions.

## Workspace Standards

- Use `PageHeader` for page-level title/description/action layout in all persona surfaces.
- Use `StatusBadge` for short status labels instead of ad-hoc badge styles in app code.
- Keep command-surface patterns (header search bars, sidebar status chips, action rows) composed from `@qryvanta/ui` primitives.

## Integration Notes

- Next.js apps should include `@qryvanta/ui` in `transpilePackages`.
- Tailwind consumers should include `packages/ui/src` as a source so classes are detected.
- Keep package APIs stable to avoid broad refactors across apps.

## Versioning and Publish

Release flow uses Changesets and GitHub Actions:

1. Add package changes in `packages/ui`.
2. Create a changeset with `pnpm changeset`.
3. Merge to `main`.
4. `.github/workflows/release-packages.yml` creates a release PR or publishes pending package versions.

Local commands:

```bash
pnpm --filter @qryvanta/ui check
pnpm --filter @qryvanta/ui build
pnpm changeset
pnpm changeset:version
pnpm changeset:publish
```

The publish workflow requires `NPM_TOKEN` in repository secrets.

## Consuming from `qryvanta.com`

After first publish, install by version in the cloud repository:

```bash
pnpm add @qryvanta/ui@latest
```

This keeps shared primitives centralized while cloud-specific components remain in `qryvanta.com`.
