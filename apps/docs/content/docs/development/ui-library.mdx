description: Shared UI component package for consistent app surfaces.
---

Qryvanta ships reusable web primitives from `@qryvanta/ui` in `packages/ui`.
The package is based on shadcn patterns and is the default source for shared application components.

## Usage

Import components from the package root:

```tsx
import { Button, Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle } from "@qryvanta/ui";
```

Do not import from `apps/web/src/components/ui` for shared primitives.

## Adding Components

1. Add the component in `packages/ui/src/components`.
2. Reuse `packages/ui/src/lib/cn.ts` for class merging.
3. Export the component from `packages/ui/src/index.ts`.
4. Update consuming apps to import from `@qryvanta/ui`.

## Integration Notes

- Next.js apps should include `@qryvanta/ui` in `transpilePackages`.
- Tailwind consumers should include `packages/ui/src` as a source so classes are detected.
- Keep package APIs stable to avoid broad refactors across apps.
