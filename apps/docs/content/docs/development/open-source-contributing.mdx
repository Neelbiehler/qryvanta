## Start Here

1. Read `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
2. Read `AGENTS.md` and `RUST_STYLE_GUIDE.md`.
3. Review architecture boundaries before implementing changes.

## Local Setup

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm infra:up
cp .env.example .env
cargo xcheck
```

Optional local coding-agent presets:

```bash
cp -R .agent.example .agent
```

`.agent/` is ignored by git and intended for machine-specific configuration.

## Pull Request Expectations

- Keep pull requests focused and explain the "why" clearly.
- Add or update tests for behavior changes.
- Keep domain logic in `crates/domain` and use-cases in `crates/application`.
- Update docs in the same PR for any externally meaningful change.

## Shared Package Releases

`@qryvanta/ui` is a publishable package from `packages/ui`.

- Use `pnpm changeset` when changing package behavior or exports.
- Validate package quality before release:

```bash
pnpm --filter @qryvanta/ui check
pnpm --filter @qryvanta/ui build
```

- Release automation is handled by `.github/workflows/release-packages.yml` using Changesets.
- Publishing requires `NPM_TOKEN` repository secret.

## Required Validation

```bash
cargo fmt --all
cargo xcheck
cargo xclippy
cargo xtest
pnpm check
pnpm lint
pnpm test
```

## Community Standards

- Follow `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` in all project spaces.
- Report security issues privately via `SECURITY.md`.

## Roadmap Alignment

Before proposing large features, check:

- `docs/ROADMAP.md`
- `apps/docs/content/docs/development/roadmap.mdx`
