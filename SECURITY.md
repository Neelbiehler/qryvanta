# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Qryvanta is under active development. Security fixes are applied to the `main`
branch first.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public GitHub issues for potential security vulnerabilities.

Instead, report privately to:

- `security@qryvanta.org`

Please include:

- A clear description of the issue and impacted area.
- Steps to reproduce (proof of concept if possible).
- Potential impact.
- Suggested mitigation, if known.

You can expect an acknowledgment within 3 business days.

## Disclosure Process

After validation, maintainers will:

1. Triage severity and impacted components.
2. Prepare and test a fix.
3. Coordinate disclosure and release notes.

We ask for responsible disclosure and reasonable time to remediate before public disclosure.
